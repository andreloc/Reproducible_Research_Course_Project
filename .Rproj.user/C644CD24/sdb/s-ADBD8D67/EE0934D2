Many severe events can result in \nfatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the \nextent possible is a key concern.\n\n### Study Goal \n\nThe basic goal is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer the following questions: \n\n1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?\n2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?\n\nThis report is intended for government or municipal manager who might be responsible \nfor preparing for severe weather events. \n\n### Data \n\nThe NOAA database is a compressed CSV file. The data was downloaded in the folloing \nlink [Sorm Data][1]. There is also some documentation of the database available \non the [Storm Data Documentation][2] and a serie of [Frequent Answered Questions][3]. \n\nThe events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier \nyears of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack \nof good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.\n\n\n### Important Links\n\n- [NOAA Database][1]\n- [National Weather Service Storm Data Documentation][2]\n- [NOAA Database FAQ][3]\n\n[1]: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2\n[2]: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf\n[3]: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf\n\n",
