### Introduction 

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic 
problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in 
fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the 
extent possible is a key concern.

### Study Goal 

The basic goal is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer the following questions: 

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

This report is intended for government or municipal manager who might be responsible 
for preparing for severe weather events. 

### Data 

The NOAA database is a compressed CSV file. The data was downloaded in the folloing link [Sorm Data][1]. 
There is also some documentation of the database available on the [Storm Data Documentation][2] and 
a serie of [Frequent Answered Questions][3]. 

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier 
years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack 
of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.
